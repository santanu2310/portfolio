description: "Space Invaders (High School Project) I used Python and Pygame to recreate the classic Space Invaders experience. Beyond the core gameplay, I focused on the 'extras' that make a game feel complete: a polished menu system, a tutorial section for players, and a pause feature to manage game states."
